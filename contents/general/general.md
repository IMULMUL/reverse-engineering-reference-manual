__What is Reverse Engineering?__
* No one likes reading another person's code. And quite frankly, I enjoy reverse engineering not because I prefer the bloated code generated by software instead. Reverse engineering is more than just reading code. It is about understanding the interactions with different layers of the software stack that are typically abstracted away in higher level programming. It is about understanding how software, that is not your own or not meant to be read by you, works with the rest of the computer system.
